I am a Mechanical and Electrical engineering major and I plan to graduate in 2028.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs 

Lab 1 
Is one of my favorite labs because it was my first time doing anything coding 
related so it was a new beginning for me. It was exciting figuring everything out 
and succeeding at it on my own. Lab 1 made me look forward to the rest of the course
and was overall a good start to the class. Since this lab was my official first time coding 
it has held a great significance to me which is why its number 1 favorite lab. 

Lab 6 , part 1 
was  focused on ‘if statements’ and using it within our program.”If statements” is a pretty
confusing topic for me to understand so throughout the lab I got confused a few times but was 
able to problem solve then get back on track. Which made me feel accomplished because I took the 
time to backtrack and see what went wrong. This lab also focused on using vectors and string which
at that point in the semester I think I understood pretty well.This lab definitely taught me to be more 
patient when coding.

Lab 10 
Focuses on 2D vectors and function definitions. This lab was a bit more confusing for me to understand
but the reason why I like it is because I had my lab partners to help me. The reason I like this lab is
because of the amount of support and help I had while having trouble understanding and coding it.
I think If I were to do it myself I would’ve been stuck so the group effort is what I liked most about this lab.
